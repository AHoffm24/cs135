C++ Arithmetic, Library Functions, and Assignment

For each of the following questions, replace the ________ with
your response.

Evaluate each of the following expressions. If the final result is
floating-point, include a decimal. Assume cmath has been included.

1. 25 / 8 - 9 % 5 => -1


2. 7 + 21 / 5 - pow(3,2) => 2


3. 9 / 2 * 3 + int(4.7) => 16


4. 4.0 * (2 / 5) - 5 => -5


5. 99 / (5 % 8) - 3 * 2.0 => 13



Suppose a program contains the following declarations and assignment
statements. Assume cmath has been included in the program.

int x, y, z;
double a, b;
x = 19;
y = 3;
a = 8.4;

Answer each of the following questions. Include a decimal if the value
stored is floating-point.

6. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = 4 + x % 6;    z is 5


7. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = int(sqrt(x+7)) + y * 2;   b is 11.099


8. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = y / 2 + 2.1;    b is 3.1



9. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = a - x % y + (x - 5) * 0.1;

   z is 21


10. What is stored in b after the statment is executed?

    b = double (x / y * 2) - a;

    b is 3.6
